<h2>MT Enhanced Trados Plugin</h2>

A plugin for SDL Trados Studio that allows connecting to Google Translate or Microsoft Translator, with additional features like batch find/replace in both directions.

To build, add a strongly-named key file to the project called 'myKey.snk'

Also add the necessary SDL references to the SDL_references folder (see references_readme.txt in that folder)
